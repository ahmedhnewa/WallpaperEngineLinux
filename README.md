This is a temporary project, 
Just a try to run wallpapers of [WallpaperEngine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en) for all the three 
Operating systems,<br>

I was planning to publish this project once it finish,
and I already start working on it since 2022 January, but I couldn't complete 
it for many reasons,
so I just decided to publish it now
<br>
**Please note** that this is not the actual project that I will continue working on it,
It just for tests, I will use Compose Desktop, Flutter, Python, or C++
